## Focus Group

Welcome to Introduction to User Experience Design.

Today we will discuss focus groups. We will discuss its goals, the type of data we can collect during this user study session. And also some advantages and disadvantages associated with this type of study technique.

- Data gathered
- Advantages and shortcomings

The goal of conducting a focus group is to engage users in direct conversations.

Focus groups take place in a controlled environment, usually a room where users can feel free to share and discuss information in a private setting.

Focus groups allow for a high degree of interaction, more so than a survey, but less so than an interview.

At this point I want to remind you that we already had a lesson on how to come up with the objective for your user study.

A focus group allows the design team to meet with a group of five to ten users. This group should be representative of the user group that the designers want to address. The design team includes a trained moderator who organizes the topics of conversation among the users. A note taker who keeps track of the major conversation points between the users and the moderator. And if possible it should also include a media person, who either audio tapes or video tapes the session.

- Focus Group Composition
  - Users
    - Between 5-10
  - Design Team
    - Moderator
    - Note taker
    - Media person (optional)

The section is structured to maximize the information gathered from a narrow set of topics. The moderator must be skillful at delving into interesting themes that arise. But also able to focus the user's input to cover the desired material.

- Focus Group Structure
  - Schedule
    - 5 minute warm up
    - 5 minute creative exercise
    - 45 minute discussion
      - 3 topics
    - 5 minute wrap up

It usually includes a warm up session, and maybe a creative exercise to get the users warmed up.

However, most of the time is spent on the discussion.

There's also the time set aside to get final thoughts that the users may have on the topic.

During the focus group session, both qualitative and quantitative data is collected.

Qualitative data may be a set of notes written by the note taker, as the conversation were going on.

Or also, it might include an entire focus group session transcripts and analysis of that session.

- Focus Group Data
  - Qualitative
    - note takers handwritten notes
    - Transcribed data

Quantitative data maybe collected at the beginning of the focus group to, for example, gather demographic information about the users. Or capture some initial survey information about their attitudes and opinions on the topic of interest.

The moderator is skilled at using this data quickly to start conversations.

  - Quantitative

All of the techniques we will discuss have advantages and shortcoming. Among the greatest advantage of the focus group is that the designer can collect rich data on a topic of interest, in a relatively short period of time. Also the group dynamic may result in data that may not have been elicited in a one to one interview.

- Focus Group
  - Advantages
    - Rich data in a timely manner
    - Group dynamic inspires

However, there's a number of shortcomings with this method as well. First you require a team to carry out this technique, also a skilled moderator to optimize the data that's collected.

The group dynamic, while it's an advantage, also may have some disadvantages. For example it may lead to groupthink where individual members start echoing what other people are saying even if they don't really believe it. Or they don't actually represent their true attitudes. Or there may be one individual in the focus group that has undue influence on the session. Because of their status within the group, or maybe some other social desirability factor.

- Focus Group
  - Disadvantages
    - Need a team headed by an experienced moderator
    - Social influence may lead to group think
    - Influential member

Focus groups, because they offer such rich data, may be the culmination of the design process.

What I mean is that although the focus group is part of an iterative design process. It may come after other less interactive techniques have been utilized, such as naturalistic observations or surveys. However, after a focus group, the designer may want to interview other users. To get information from interesting themes that arose during the focus group.

I just gave you an example of how you might use the entire iterative process. But we could just as easily have developed an interview following the focus group. The point is to conduct the technique that provides us with the information we need.

In this lesson, we reviewed focus groups.
