# Syllabus

The material does not include specific readings I do however include a set of resources that are related to each of the modules. These are all material that I collected through web searches.

There are two ways to take this course-- 

Informal: simply go through the lecture notes and see if the material piques your interest. If it does then you are ready to engage the material in a formal manner. If it doesn't then move on to another course and see what really motivates you.

Formal: take the course for credit-- research shows that to learn material well you must be TESTED on that material! If you went through the material in an informal manner and found it compelling, then sign up for the course and get a Coursera Credit for it. When you do so, there are also a set of exercises and discussion board activities included in the course. Engage your peers and instructor.

Beyond Online Resources: I highly recommend these books

Trade Book: 

The Design of Everyday Things, 2013 edition by Don Norman

Text Books: 

Interaction Design by Jennifer Preece, Helen Sharp and Yvonne Rogers (in alphabetical order). There are four editions of this book. I believe any of the editions are a good purchase. This is the book I use in my undergraduate college course.

Human Computer Interaction, 2004 by Dix, Finlay, Abowd & Beale. This is an advance text book.

Understanding Your Users, 2015 edition by Baxter, Courage & Caine. I really like this book because it does what it claims,  provides a  "practical guide to User Research Methods."
