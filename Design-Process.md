# 4 Step Design Process

## The course is based on a 4 step design process:

### Step1: Requirements Gathering

- Understanding the user and what her goals are.
- What are the current practices
- This step can also be thought of as understanding the "problem space"- what is hindering the completion of the task how can the task or process be improved
- A whole host of techniques are presented that allow the designer to collect data about the user, her goals and current practices

### Step 2: Design Alternatives

- Once you understand the users, their goals, and their current practices (e.i., the problem space) you are able to take this data and develop various design options that will improve the user experience 

### Step 3: Protoyping

- Techniques for modelling the novel designs before a final version is produced

### Step 4: Evaluation 

- A set of techniques for ascertaining that your design meets the needs of the user
