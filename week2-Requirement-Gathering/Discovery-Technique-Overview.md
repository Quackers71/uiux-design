## Discovery Technique Overview

Welcome to User Experience Design. In this lesson, you will get an overview of the techniques used in the requirements-gathering process to discover the user's current practices.

As I told you earlier, the goal of the requirements gathering phase it to understand the problem space. This requires that we 

- Collect information from the user 
- About the user to better understand their current practices and their needs.

We will review four discovery techniques that provide us insight into 

- How the user is currently accomplishing their tasks?
  - In **'Naturalistic Observations'**, we simply observe the user as she goes about completing her task.
  - When we use the **'Survey'** method, we get the user to fill out a questionnaire and report on what they do and why they do it.
  - In the **'Focus group'** we have formal conversations with five to seven users about their practices.
  - Finally we have the **'Interview'**, where the designer has a one-to-one interaction with the user.

The designer asks the user about her current practices.

At this point, I want to remind you that we have already had a lesson on the process to follow when you interact with users. We discuss in detail a process to engaged before, during and after interacting with users.

The four techniques I describe to you can be organized a number of ways. These techniques can be thought of us being a continuum.

From not interacting with the user at all on a naturalistic observation, to having one to one conversations with the user.

We can also think about these measures as they relate to where we use a technique. In the field or in an office.

In this module, I presented the most common techniques available to design and I presented them an isolation.

- How the user is currently accomplishing their tasks?
  - Naturalistic Observation
  - Surveys
  - Focus groups
  - Interviews

The fact is that we can develop the best designs when we use a couple of these techniques in one design cycle. Further, these techniques can be seen as iterative or finding from one technique can focus how we conduct other techniques. I will talk about these further.

In up coming lectures I will discuss each of these techniques in much more detail. I'll tell you about the goal of each technique, what type of data is collected during this technique, how the data can be used as well as advantages and short comings of each of these techniques.
